A Pen created on Vinishireis

Glowy Hover Effects refer to a set of visual enhancements applied to elements on a webpage or user interface when a user hovers over them. These effects are achieved through the manipulation of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) properties and sometimes involve the integration of JavaScript for more dynamic behavior.
